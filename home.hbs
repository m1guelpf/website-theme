    <p>I'm currently dedicating most of my time to <a href="https://blogcast.host/?ref=website" target="_blank">Blogcast</a>, a service that uses state of the art text-&#65279;to-&#65279;speech technology to automate article narration.</p>
  
    <p>Before Blogcast, I built <a href="https://unmarkdocs.co/?ref=website" target="_blank">UnMarkDocs</a>, an app that generated beautiful documentation pages using a superpowered in-house markdown flavour. UnMarkDocs was my first paid app and an amazing learning experience on how it is to sell something in the real world.</p>
  
    <p>I started and mantain an <a href="https://snaptier.com/?ref=website" target="_blank">Snaptier</a> or Maker Army.</p>
  
    <p>I'm currently studying the <a href="https://www.ibo.org/about-the-ib/" target="_blank">International Baccalaureate</a> and researching about philosophy, psychology and many other things I consider interesting on the side.</p>

    <p>If you've reached this point, you probably want to <a href="{{@site.url}}/projects">find out more about my projects</a> or <a href="{{@site.url}}/articles">read my articles</a>. You can also <a href="{{twitter_url @blog.twitter}}" target="_blank">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I normally share what I'm working on.</p>
